    "The user determines the size of the cube by providing the upper and lower boundaries. These are determined by the variables RAmin (minimum right ascension of cube in deg), RAmax (maximum right ascension of cube in deg), Demin (minimum declination of cube in deg), Demax (maximum declination of cube in deg), numin (minimum frequency of cube in Hz), numax (maximum frequency of cube in Hz). The voxel size is determined by the spatial voxel size cdeltxy (in deg) and the frequency voxel size cdeltnu in Hz.\n",

    "The positions of the pointings are provided in a list ras of right ascensions ras and declinations de, either as floats in units of deg or in hexagesimal units (provided as strings). Optionally, the user supplies names for the pointings in a list names of strings. \n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, the user can automatically generate a grid confined by a polygon, if she sets grid_from_polygon = True\n",
    "The vertices are given by polypointsx and polypointsy, which are lists of numpy-readable angles (e.g. 15.0, '15deg', '1h00m00s', '15d00m00s' all for 15 deg). The regular polygonal grid, either 'hexagonal' or 'quadradic' (determined by parameter gridtype), has a separation of sep for the grid points (sep in units of degrees), and is tilted by the angle tilt (in degrees). The lateral shift of the grid is determined by the position given by the pair startpoint, and is by default the barycentre of the grid, if startpoint = None. Startpoint should be chosen to lie inside the polygon. The parameter border (in degrees) determines a border of the grid towards the polygon. If border is positive, no grid point can have a distance lower than border towards the input polygon. If border is negative, grid points outside the polygon are allowed if their distance to a side of the polygon is less than the absolute value of border. The pointings are automatically named prefix-number using the parameter prefix as a prefix and increasing integers starting with 00.\n",

The parameter pbshape determines the shape of the primary beam 'Tapered Cos Squared' (see Mauch, et al. 2020, ApJ, 888, 61) or Gaussian. The script will first calculate a weight map (or rather a cube with frequency as the third axis), the inverse of the noise map in units of the inverse of rmsrel. If rmsrel is chosen to be the rms at the centre of a single pointing (same as rmsbeam), this shows hence the increase in signal-to-noise (sensitivity) relative to the signal-to-noise (sensitivity) at the centre of a single beam. The weight map (cube) can be returned as a fits data cube with the name specified in the parameter weightmapname. Then the noise map, the inverse of the weight map (cube) in units of Jy is calculated, clipped at values above the clipper parameter. This map (cube), representing the expected rms across the field, can be saved as a fits file with the name rmsmapname.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following some statistics is carried out for pixel values in the noise cube below the clip value statmax and, if a polygon was specified, inside the polygon. A viewgraph is generated showing the area having an rms noise below a threshold rms_max. This, togeter with the numbers is the important figure of merit, which shows you whether your mosaic is wisely chosen. Assuming your science requires an rms of xxx, then you can determine the area that you are covering at this rms and below from this viewgraph. The numbers calculated for the polygon can show you these quantities in your region of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the mosaic pointings are listed, a map is presented showing the weights cube as a greyscale map with a minimum vmin and maximum vmax for the colour wedge and showing the rms as contours, the levels of which are provided by the user in the list rmscontours. This is done for the channel mapchannel (index starting with 0) in the rms/weights cube."
